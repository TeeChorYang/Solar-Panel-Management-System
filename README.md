To meet its energy needs, Malaysia now heavily depends on fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas. Relying on non-renewable resources not only poses environmental concerns, but also puts the nation at risk for changes in energy prices. One of the primary challenges in the renewable energy sector in Malaysia is the regulatory framework. Despite the government's efforts to promote renewable energy with incentives, more comprehensive policies are required to attract investors and facilitate project development. Building the necessary infrastructure for renewable energy projects is another hurdle.
This includes the development of solar and wind farms, hydroelectric dams, and biomass facilities. These projects require substantial investments and efficient infrastructure planning. Furthermore, it's not always easy to secure financing for renewable energy projects. Obtaining loans or investors can be difficult due to the high initial costs, which necessitates demonstrating a solid business case and reliable revenue projections. Finally, it is also a technical challenge to integrate renewable energy sources into the existing power grid. Adapting Malaysia's power grid to handle renewable energy can be complex due to its primarily designed for conventional energy sources.
